# Session 3, 20th September
Date of session: 2022-01-19  
In-game day count: Day 1 to Day 1  

## Session Summary
After fighting off the rats at the warehouse, we take sickened Triton back to the tavern and we set up "The Call of Adventure" for the village.

Next we went back to investigate the source of the rats, and finding some tracks head out of the village; Hildi the Herbalist catchs us first and offers us some healing potions to aid in our task. Following the tracks from the warehouse we make it to the rat's nest. We successfully defeat the rats in the nest, and take the Enormous Rat's head back for proof, it wasn't an easy victory and we nearly lost Zalhelm in the fight, and both Zalhelm & Aethelbert contracted Filth Fever from the rats.

Returning to town, Aethelbert presented the proof to Elder Jacob and the party was rewarded with some gold, rooms & baths in the tavern, and healing help from Hildi.
We take our well earned rest, Zalhelm & Aethelbert being treated for their diseases, and Tuco we try to keep away from the rats skull so he doesn't get diseased to. Maybe after a couple of days we will have the chance to make it into a helmet.

## Log
Active lead: The rats attacking Alorn

- Outside the tavern of Alorn with the party
- Triton gives an artifact to Aethelbert and then **Triton heads inside to rest up at the tavern**
	- a white, football sized, d2 shaped objects with the adventurer's guild emblem
	- "The Call to Adventure"
- & a note with instructions on how to set it up
	- needs an adventurer to set up
- It is to be left at the village for their use
- The rest of the party clearly have not been with the guild long
- Elder Jacob comes to us, and Aethel tells him about the artefact to set up
- Aethel sets it up outside (nearby)
	- It glows a light blue, the ground shakes and a giant stone fist appears out of the ground & clutches the artifact
	- Aethel presses the AG emblem and a projection of a person appears
- This guy is an AG representative
- We talk about the mission we are on to deal with the RoUS
	- He mentions how Zalhelm is documenting everything
- His name is Patrick the Call Master
	- Aethel mentions that we're down a party member and he keeps assuming that means Triton is now dead.
- I asked him how I would go about joining the AG, can me joining in on the rat hunting adventure count as my application?
	- Response is yes, maybe. Helping with the mission may count towards my application
	- I should see either the boss, Rubray Kiddie (she) or the cleric Norgoth Forgehide
- The call of adventure can now be used by the village to contact the AG when they need them.

- Aethel asks Jacob about the rat source
	- They come in the warehouse side of the village only
	- first they were attacking the crops in the fields that side of the village
	- they seem to come at all times of day but mostly at night
- We go to investigate the warehouse
	- The rats have been breaking in to the warehouses
	- We find tracks
- As we head off to follow the tracks a halfling calls to us and runs up.
	- This female halfing is Hildi the Herbalist
	- She hands us a bag of helpful items to aid in our task
		- 1 healing potion each (4 total), and 1 elixir of health each (4 total) (helps fight disease)

- Following the tracks we head out, and eventually come to some holes in the ground, some are pretty big, some would only fit small creature through
- Tuco heads straight into the first hole he find that will fit him, I follow him in
- It's pitch black and I can't see as I have low-light but not darkvision
	- Tuco can see
	- Tuco sits me down where I am and wanders off
- Then Zal & Aeth enter through a larger hole and Zal has lit the end of his staff
	- We stand around discussing what we should be doing and then the rats hear us in their nest and come at us

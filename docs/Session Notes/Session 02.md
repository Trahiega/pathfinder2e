# Session 2, Goblins are scary!
Session Date: Tuesday, 6th September 2022

![[Session2.png]] 

## Session Summary
After a battle with some goblins, [[Thynglybeth Thildellom|Thynglybeth]] came across the party. She had set out from the village of [[Alorn]] to find out what was taking the [[Adventurer's Guild]] so long to come to their aid.

Joining together to travel to the village, the party set up camp for the night. Not long into their night's rest, they were beset upon by another group of goblins. Recognising the runaway from earlier that day, they realise that the surviving goblin had gone to rally their allies. Managing a nights rest after the fight, the party headed to [[Alorn]] the next day.

Arriving in Alorn, we meet Elder Jacob then are alerted to a rat attack in the warehouse. We head over and kill the rats, but Triton falls ill with Filth Fever contracted from the rat swarm and will need a few days to recover.

## Next steps & Loose Ends
[[Triton Stormwind]] is infected with [[Filth Fever]] from the [[Rat Swarm]] we fought in the barns. He'll need a few days of rest.

We need to find the source of the rats attacking Alorn.

Questions for the party
- When did they join the adventurer's guild?
- Zalhelm
	- What are all those notes he's taking?

### Rules & Forge
Haven't done a bulk calculation.
- Foundry lets you put items in containers, very handy.    

Familiar
- Isn't designed to be use for attacking
- Need to find out in what ways it is useful

Compendium on Foundry has all of the actions in that I can drag onto my character sheet, useful to be able to check rules / make rolls

- Don't forget multiple attack penalty
- Devise a Stratagem
	- because you roll the d20 in advance, you can decided whether it's worth using that roll to attack, or if it's best to just do something else
